This repository contains different crates for solving the [Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem) in the [Rust Programming Language](https://rust-lang.org/). The TSP is a classic optimization problem where the goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits a set of cities and returns to the origin city.
